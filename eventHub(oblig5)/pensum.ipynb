    "I'll explain how the database connection works in this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the DataBase class constructor, the connection is established to:\n",

    "A MySQL server running on \"localhost\" (your local machine)\n",
    "Using username \"root\"\n",
    "With password from environment variables\n",
    "Connecting to a database named \"dte_2509\"\n",
    "The SQL file (users.sql) is just a script that defines the structure of tables, but it needs to be executed against an existing MySQL server to create those tables.\n",

    "Database Setup and Connection Process\n",
    "MySQL Server: The actual database system is MySQL, which needs to be installed and running on your computer (\"localhost\"). This is completely separate from your SQL definition files.\n",

    "Database Creation: Before your code can work, you need to manually create a database named \"dte_2509\" on your MySQL server. This would typically be done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "Table Creation: The users.sql file contains the SQL commands to create your tables, but it doesn't automatically execute. You need to run this file against your MySQL server:\n",

    "Password: from an environment variable DB_PASSWORD\n",
    "Database name: dte_2509\n",
    "Connection Process: When you instantiate the DataBase class, mysql.connector opens a connection to the MySQL server running on your machine and selects the \"dte_2509\" database to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database isn't \"in\" the SQL file - the SQL file is just a script that defines the structure. The actual database exists as files managed by your MySQL server, typically stored in locations like /var/lib/mysql on Linux or C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server X.X\\Data on Windows, depending on your MySQL installation."

    "Takes a user_id parameter (which Flask-Login passes from the session)\n",

    "\n",
    "Without this function, features like @login_required and current_user wouldn't work properly, as Flask-Login wouldn't be able to determine if a user is authenticated or who the current user is."
